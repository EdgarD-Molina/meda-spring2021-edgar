    <br>

    <p>Hey, my name is Danny. I've been playing guitar since I was 16 years old. I'm 31 now, so I guess you could say I've taken to this hobby quite well. 
    <br>
    I used to spend a lot of my time in front of the tv screen playing Zelda or Metroid video games, but as I got older and moved around to different schools I picked up a lot of different friends. 
    <br>
    A lot of them invested in their own hobbies, but most commonly I kept hearing about the guitar. Being a teenager I, of course, wanted to get in on this trend. 
    <br>
    When my birthday rolled around I begged and pleaded with my parents, grandparents, and siblings to get me one. 
    <br>
    <i>Boy, was I surprised.</i> 
    <br>
    They wound up buying me a bass guitar. What a moment I tell you. But still, I figured if I could master this thing maybe they'll buy me a guitar for christmas! 
    <br>
    So time went on and lo and behold, i'm now frequently teaching people to play guitar on my spare time. </p>

        <h2> Why do you want to play guitar? </h2>

    <br>
    <br> 
        <p>
            I love what I do strictly because I've always been blessed with a musical ear, but that doesn't mean you need one to enjoy playing guitar.
            <br> 
            If you wanna use it as a way to meet people, an avenue to other instruments, actually start a band, maybe use it to meet someone you've had your eye on?
            <br> 
            I don't know. But that's up to you. 
            <br>
            I love it for all of those reasons. Guitar is one door that opens many opportunities. Most importantly it lets my creativity flow out and alleviates stress or negative thoughts. 
            <br>
            Something definitely worth mentioning here too. 
            <br>
            It has been scientifically proven that playing instruments helps release dopamine. Long story short that's the chemical your body releases when you're happy, laughing, and just having a good time. 
            <br>
            I find myself often writing some of my best material when I feel uneasy and a lot weighing on my mind. 
            <br>
            So for me, guitar can be therapy, an avenue for friendship, a chance to make some side money, a chance to just show the world I can hang out too. 
            <br>
            What it is for you won't be obvious right away, and in knowing that, take some time to just understand it an try something new.

    <h3> Let's actually play! </h3>
        <p> So you're already interested in playing, I mean why else be here? Let's really get started here. 
            <br>We will be needing just a few things:</p>
    
            <ol>
                <li> Any guitar, literally. 6 strings is the requirement here.
                       Nylon or steel strings does not matter here. If you can play one, you can play the other.
                    (Don't tell anyone I said this, but I guess you could also use a bass.)
                </li>
                <li> Patience 
                    This goes without saying but a lot of people quit 2 or 3 days in because they wan't to be good immediately. </li>
                <li> Time
                    This is literally like anything that you will ever do in life. You have to make time every day to play. </li>
            </ol>

            </figure>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p> 
            The one thing i recommend most when starting out is simply understanding your instrument and how to use your hands seperately. You'll struggle a bit at first trying to differentiate your left from your right. But just hang in there. 
            <br>These two skills will go hand-in-hand. (I couldn't resist.)
            <br>
            Start out by simply holding it. The main part of the guitar is the neck. You'll notice the little metal spacers between sections. 
            These are called frets. They each produce a unique note when played.
            <br>
            At the very top of your guitar you'll see the 6 knobs that both hold your strings in place, and can help you tune your guitar.
            This is called the head, it is home to the tuning keys (the "knobs") 
            <br> <br>
            I highly recommend <a href="https://www.musiciansfriend.com/accessories/snark-all-instrument-tuner-metronome"> this tuner. </a> 
            <br> I've used ones very simliar to this and it will hold you over for at least a year or two as you learn.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Again, the guitar neck is your main piece. This is home to your frets and the position markers.
            The fret itself is just each little square between the metal dividers. 
            The position markers are the little dots across the neck. they go over 'odd' numbers on the frets. except for the one with 2 dots. that's the 12th fret.
            <br>
            After that though, it picks up on the odds again. They are also seen on the side of the neck too incase you can't see the front for some reason. 
            <br>
            You'll find after some time you'll start naturally using these as a guide to where your sounds should be. 
            <br>
            Although I recommend learning to tune by ear by watching various youtube videos
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <a href="https://youtu.be/5jTsSvkBv60"> Check out how to tune your guitar here </a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p> Lastly there's your strings. 6 of them (or 4 on bass) <br>
            These are most commonly referred to by 'ascending' order. <br>
            What that means is we list them off from the lowest note to the highest, brightest note.<br>
            You will have E, A, D, G, B, e. </p>
            <br> <br> <br>
    <figure> 
        <img src="Generic Guitar 3.jpg" alt="Simple image of a guitar head showing string positions" width="500px" height="285px" />
        <figcaption> Here you can clearly see which string is which and their positions. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br> <br> <br>

    <p> 
        Yes, the first and last strings share the same name. <br>
        More importantly the capitilization is important too. It is used to differentiate which string you're going to be playing. <br>
        So defintiely do your best to remember them.<br>
        <ol>
            <li>The biggest fat string is called the E. </li>
            <li>The string next to that is the A. </li>
            <li>The string after is the D string. </li>
            <li>The 4th string in series is going to be the G.</li>
            <li>The 5th string is called the B string.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the 6th string is the e string. </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        You'll notice the B and the e strings are significantly thinner than the first 4 strings. This will also help you remember what strings are which.
        <br>
        This part is where a lot of players become divided. <br>
        I personally play with a pick, but others swear by using their fingers. If i can be honest, i'd suggest using your fingers to pluck and strum. However I cannot personally help you with this technique as I don't do it myself very much. 
        <br>
        But a lot of players that use their fingers primarily are often times better players than those who do use picks. Not to mention they can usually play with a pick if the need should arise.
        Whereas a pick player won't have that same adaptability at their disposal. 
        <br> <br>
        Okay. The good stuff
    </p>

            <figcaption> You'll be using your 4 fingers in this exact position as you practice this first lesson. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br> <br>
    <p>
    Ideally begin by using only your pointer finger, after a while you should switch over to your middle finger, then your ring, and eventually your pinky.
    <br>
    You'll start by placing your finger on the first fret like I have done so in the image above. Go ahead and pluck that note at the bottom half on your guitar. 
    <br>
    i don't think this needs much instruction, but for the sake of brevity, i'll brief you on this. 
    <br>
    Try to play above the "sound hole" if you're on an acoustic guitar or playing over your pickups if you're on an electric. 
    They are both in the same general location. It just depends on what device you're using. 
    <br>
    Now try and stay on the first 3 frets and keep plucking the note with all your fingers.
    <br>
    I recommend hit the note 8 times in succession then try it with a different finger. If you make a mistake just brush it off and start the 8-count all over. 
    Honestly do this for about 2 or 3 days and you'll find yourself traveling all over the fret board without even thinking about it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This wraps up our introduction to playing. At this point it's more about knowing your instrument and becoming comfortable with it. 
    If you feel like you're good enough, take a look at <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/explore"> this website. </a>
    <br> <br>
    It's a popular site used by musicians everywhere to learn songs. Although I won't teach you to read the tabs on the website, you might be smart enough to learn on your own if you followed this lesson and did your practice!

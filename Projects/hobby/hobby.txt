--Header about playing guitar as a hobby--

--Image of random guitar player on stage--

Hey, my name is Danny. I've been playing guitar since I was 16 years old. I'm 31 now, so I guess you could say I've taken to this hobby quite well. I used to spend a lot of my time in front of the tv screen playing Zelda or Metroid video games, but as I got older and moved around to different schools I picked up a lot of different friends. A lot of them invested in their own hobbies, but most commonly I kept hearing about the guitar. Being a teenager I, of course, wanted to get in on this trend. When my birthday rolled around I begged and pleaded with my parents, grandparents, and siblings to get me one. Boy, was I surprised. They wound up buying me a bass guitar. What a moment I tell you. But still, I figured if I could master this thing maybe they'll buy me a guitar for christmas! So time went on and lo and behold, i'm now frequently teaching people to play guitar on my spare time.

I love what I do strictly because I've always been blessed with a musical ear, but that doesn't mean you need one to enjoy playing guitar. If you wanna use it as a way to meet people, an avenue to other instruments, actually start a band, maybe use it to meet someone you've had your eye on? I don't know. But that's up to you.

I love it for all of those reasons. Guitar is one door that opens many opportunities. Most importantly it lets my creativity flow out and alleviates stress or negative thoughts. I find myself often writing some of my best material when I feel uneasy and a lot weighing on my mind. So for me, guitar can be therapy, an avenue for friendship, a chance to make some side money, a chance to just show the world I can hang out too. What it is for you won't be obvious right away, and in knowing that take some time to just understand it an try something new.

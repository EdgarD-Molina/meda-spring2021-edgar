            <p class="bodytext1">Hey there, my name is Edgar Daniel Molina Gamboa. But I just go by Danny. I'm in my 30's, like most folks right now, finding my strife.<br> 
                I always thought by now I'd be stuck at some big box retailer or something less exciting.<br>
                Until one day I just decided I wanted more. I went ahead and followed my dreams of working with computers and the like. <br>
                I've always loved taking things apart and fixing them. I don't just mean computers either. I was dissasembling toys, televisions, dvd players, bikes, door handles, radios etc.
                <br>
                If it had a power source in it, I was at it the moment it broke and somebody wanted to throw it away.<br> 
                So I guess you can sat I am definitely interested more in how things function and how to make them functional again.
                <br><br> 
                
                That's me in a brief summary. Aside from that, I love video games, learning to cook, and playing music. Standard fare.

                This site has been my only project thus far worth mentioning. However it was a lot of fun making it. 
                <br>
                For this project in particular I used a lot of my early notes in HTML and some CSS with a lot of reference to class material.
                <br>
                It is amazing how much I have actually learned without realizing it.
                <br>
                I'm rather proficient at microsoft office, having used it now for almost two decades. 
                I've been using windows mostly since ME (2000) and I can dabble in iOS as well. 
                I've used Mac OS since Tiger was launched back in 2005. I've used almost all following updates since then. 
                 </p>

            <footer id="footer"><p> My favorite in particular of the office suite would be excel. 
            <br>
            I got to learn a ton about it at my last job as an accountant.
            <br>
            After excel I would say my new favorite would be visual code studio. 
            <br>
            Having learned how to use this from class, I've been able to actually learn a lot of code on my own time outside of class.
            <br>

            </footer>
